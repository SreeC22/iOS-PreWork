# PreWork - *Tip Calci*

**Tip Calci** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Sreekaree Chityala**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] build setting page but unable to figure out how to use Userdefault 
- [x] self-designed page

## Notes

I spent a lot of time figuring out how to create another view Controller. I tried to save the data through UserDefault but I failed. Instead of wasting more time, I decide to submit the prework first and keep trying to solve the problems.
